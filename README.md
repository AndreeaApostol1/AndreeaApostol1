# [APOSTOL ANDREEA-GEORGIANA] - Aspiring Junior Software Tester (Manual & Automation)



## About Me

I am an economics graduate with a strong desire to undergo a professional transformation into the role of a Junior Software Tester, specializing in both manual and automation testing. My background in economics has equipped me with essential skills such as analytical thinking and meticulous attention to detail, which I believe are assets that can be effectively applied to identifying and reporting software defects.

In my previous professional experience, I successfully controlled costs and optimized spending through the restructuring of budgets for labor, capital assets, inventory purchasing, and technology upgrades. Additionally, I have experience collecting, organizing, and modeling data using MS Office, further enhancing my analytical capabilities.

I recently completed a comprehensive course in Manual Testing and Introduction to Automation at Wantsome, where I gained valuable skills and knowledge in various aspects of software testing. This includes manual testing, bug reporting with Jira, test levels, test types, test techniques, and Agile methodology. I also acquired proficiency in several key tools and technologies relevant to software testing, including Java, OOP, Postman, API testing, Selenium, database (MySQL), and basic web page checks. I have experience working with locators, input fields, and simulating user interactions such as clicking, dragging, typing, and scrolling. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of test plans and bug management.
